# _DEVSNFT

## Version 1.0.0 face generated, based on real people input

A collection of nfts based on real developers and their skillset.

So basicly the nft asset will look like a pokemon card.
On this card there will be stats of somekind (still to be determined) 

These are some of the items that will be on the card:
- a random generated image of a 'developer' (currently only men)
  - asian, caucasian, bum, black, ...
- above it's name (realname of nicknames)
- underneath the image: the function of the dev
- at the stats level: 
  - skill sets: ...
  - hobbies
  - likes and dislikes
  - fav quote
- on the bottom the nft card of 100?



### create a rarity table
